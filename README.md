# BOOKSTORE-ASSESMENT
data questionnaire for Data Engineer position for Kotak Sakti

Bookstore.py is the code that I used to connect the database which i used Microsft SQL Server Management to store all the data. 
As I'm using MYSQL I need to use pyodbc library to complete this mini assesment.
I run the code using jupyter-notebook as it was a versatile and easy to use for me.

I guess that's all I have to say for now. Feel free to contact me for further information.
